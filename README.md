# TwitchViewsMonitorJS
```
This is a very basic JS project that will simply monitor a live twitch channel and output to a graph
This project uses the main API to return the current views and simply logs them into an array
As you will be able to see this also has a "Export function" to save the data as a .CSV file

This project is mainly based on "Chart.JS" to provide a nice output
Also thanks to the one guy on stack overflow who got straight to the point :)
